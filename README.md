# TimeWindowSelection
A module for selecting the best time window to extract system dynamics logs (values) from event logs.
- Run **"TWSelection-SD.py"** file, it calls other methods inside. 
- The project includes data extraction, feature extraction, time series analysis, and model training and predicting for the extracted features. 
- The ARIMA models are used for predicting the time series. 
- The "event_log.csv" is a sample event log, which shows the expected format and can be used for testing the approach.
